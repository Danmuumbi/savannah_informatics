# Savannah Informatics Backend Engineer Assessment

**Author:** Daniel Muuo Muumbi  
**Live Demo:**  
- **Admin Interface:** [Admin Dashboard](https://savannah-informatics-assignment.onrender.com/admin/) (username: `root`, password: `savannah2025`)  
- **Customer Portal:** [Customer Portal](https://savannah-informatics-assignment-3.onrender.com/)  
**Source Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Danmuumbi/savannah_informatics)

## 1. Introduction

This project was built as part of the Savannah Informatics Backend Engineer technical interview. It demonstrates the design and deployment of a full-stack backend service using Python and Django, while showcasing:
- RESTful API design
- Secure authentication (OAuth2/OpenID Connect)
- Relational database design with hierarchical product categories
- Automated notifications (SMS & Email)
- Containerization & cloud deployment (Docker + Render)

The aim was to create a production-ready prototype that is both scalable and easy to understand for recruiters and engineers alike.

## Why the Application is Divided into Frontend and Backend

This solution is intentionally organized into two distinct parts:

### 1. Frontend (Customer Portal)
[Customer Portal](https://savannah-informatics-assignment-3.onrender.com/)
This is the public-facing side of the system, created to showcase my ability to implement modern authentication using OAuth2 / OpenID Connect. Here, customers can:
- Sign in securely using Google sign-in or receive a one-time login link by email.
- After successful login, view their own orders in a simple, user-friendly dashboard.

### 2. Backend (Admin Dashboard)
[Admin Dashboard](https://savannah-informatics-assignment.onrender.com/admin/)
This is the administrative side of the system, where the core business logic resides. Here, the admin can:
- Manage users, customers, products, categories, and orders.
- Trigger automated notifications:
  - SMS alerts to customers using the Africaâ€™s Talking SMS gateway.
  - Email notifications to the administrator with order details.

## 2. Key Features at a Glance
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage customers, users, categories, products, and orders through a secure Django admin panel.
- **Role Management**: Use of Django Groups to assign different privileges to team members.
- **Customer Portal**: Simple, user-friendly login via Google sign-in (OAuth2/OpenID) or email one-time login link.
- **Order Notifications**: SMS alert to the customer using Africaâ€™s Talking sandbox and email notification to the administrator.
- **Hierarchical Categories**: Products can belong to categories of any depth (e.g., Bakery â†’ Bread â†’ Wholemeal).
- **REST API Endpoints**: Checking customer existence and retrieving their orders.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized and hosted on Render for easy scalability.

## 3. System Overview

**Architecture**:  
`[Customer Frontend] -> [Django Backend] -> [PostgreSQL DB]`

- **Backend**: Python 3 + Django + Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub + Render deployment
- **Messaging**: Africaâ€™s Talking SMS sandbox & Email SMTP

## 4. How It Works

### Admin Side:
1. **Login**: Use the admin credentials to access the Django admin panel.
2. **Manage Users**: Add co-workers and assign them to groups with specific privileges.
3. **Customers**: Create customer records with name, email, phone, and address.
4. **Categories & Products**: Build multi-level product categories and add products under them.
5. **Orders**: Place orders on behalf of customers, triggering an SMS to the customer and an email to the administrator instantly.

### Customer Side:
1. **Pre-registration**: The admin must add the customer first.
2. **Login Options**: Continue with Google (OAuth2/OpenID) or Manual Email Login â€“ Customer enters name & email and receives a one-time secure login link.
3. **Dashboard**: Customers can view all their past orders.

## 5. REST API Examples

Sample endpoints powering the frontend:
- **/api/check_customer** (GET): Verify if a customer exists by email & name.
- **/api/customer_orders** (GET): Retrieve all orders belonging to a given customer.

Responses are JSON formatted, making it easy for the frontend to consume.

## 6. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Implemented for key admin operations such as adding customers and managing orders.
- **Coverage**: Basic coverage achieved; due to time constraints, full end-to-end testing was not completed.

## 7. Deployment

- **Containerization**: The entire project is Dockerized for portability.
- **Hosting**: Deployed to Render using Docker images.
- **Version Control & CI/CD**: GitHub repository with clear commit history and automatic deployment triggered by Git pushes.

## 8. Getting Started Locally (For Developers)

For technical reviewers who wish to run it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danmuumbi/savannah_informatics.git
cd savannah_informatics
docker-compose up --build
```


The app will be available at ```http://localhost:8000/.```

9. Future Improvements
Add full integration & end-to-end tests for higher coverage.
Enhance the frontend with richer UI/UX features.
Expand SMS & email notifications for more event types.
Kubernetes deployment for large-scale production environments.
10. Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Savannah Informatics for providing this engaging and challenging assessment. This project reflects my commitment to clean code, secure practices, and scalable architecture.
